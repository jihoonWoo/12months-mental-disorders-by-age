# 12months-mental-disorders-by-age

This repository facilitates the process of generating insight from the Australia Mental health survey data. Specifically the software in this repository describes how we identified : “In 2007, 26.4% of Australians aged 16-24 years reported experiencing mental ill-health (disorder) within 12 months.”. 

The Australia Mental Health Survey data was collected from ABS-National-Survey-of-Mental-Health-and-Wellbeing (10.5281/zenodo.4939861)  Zenodo repository that contains information about Australians’ mental health and well-being in 2007. We created a Jupyter Notebook called “prepare_and_setup.ipynb” to read this data and extract insight by using Python code.
